# Installation

If your are starting a new project, begin by initializing `npm` in your project folder

```
npm init
```


Start by installing Webpack globally

```
npm install -g webpack
```

When developing, it is good practice to add Webpack as a dependency to your project.

```
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Webpack comes with a package for use while developing, so go ahead an install it.

```
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
```
