**This is a work in progress don't hesitate to contribute on the [Github repository](https://github.com/alexandrebodin/webpack-book)**

Webpack is a great tool I have been using for some time and I love it!

Even though some of the best starter-kits use it, there are still lots of people not using it because they find the documentation obscure.

## Webpack and it's documentation

Reading the Webpack documentation, I can see why some people think it's not worth it to start using Webpack, but it is!

The learning curve looks steep, but I believe with a more hands on approach, we can level it and make Webpack accessible to all.

## Disclaimer

* I am not involved in Webpack's development. 
* All thoughts in this book are mine, so don't hesitate to give feedback.
* I feel this tool deserves more love than it receives. 
* I believe that if you want better documentation you should contribute somehow.


## Prerequisites

I am going to try to start from the beginning and not to leave anyone behind. If you feel some part of this book is difficult to understand just let me know!

* You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
* I will assume you know basic Javascript. 
* I will use `ES2015` syntax for my examples so go and take a look at [Babel learn ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

* To Webpack for being an awesome tool and letting me create apps without thinking too much on my development pipeline.
